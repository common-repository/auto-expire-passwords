== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've found a bug? =
* Please report any bugs to https://github.com/telegraph/Expire-User-Passwords/issues.

= I want the expiry period to be different from 30 days? =
* In your wp-config.php file, add a define called 'TMG_AEP_EXPIRY', and set the value to the number of seconds until you want the log in to expire.

= How are WordPress' log in cookies handled? =
* When a user's password expires, that user is prevented from being able to log in on your site until they reset their password.
* If a user has a log in cookie set, and so are already logged in, they can still use your site until that cookie expires or they log out manually. WordPress cookies expire after 2 weeks, so a user account could remain active for 30 days plus 2 weeks.

== Screenshots ==
